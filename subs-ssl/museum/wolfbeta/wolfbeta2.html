<p><em>What?</em> We offer business lunch solutions. </p>
<p>It means: we deliver your favourite food to your working space. It's  more about big pre-orders on regulary basis, like if you have lunch together on tuesday. You don't really need to work or being into business to use our service. </p>
<p><em>Who?</em> It's powered by AMRAS Pop Up Collective A.K.A. Kolyma2, that's like to say: extremly hot. Our Partner-Restaurants &lt;3, and you &lt;3 are also part of the team. </p>
<p>Or: The new shiny product of AMRAS Pop Up Collective A.K.A etc. We have  an &quot;about us&quot;: check it to know who we are. </p>
<p><em>How?</em> Easy. There are just <strong>three rules</strong>. It means: It's easier than the fight club and like  the fight club  you don't need an App to join it. Apps are so 2019! Take a step back into the future. And yes! Tell your friends and collegues about us.<br>
</p>
<h2>0.  THREE (3) EASY RULES</h2>
<h2>1.&nbsp;BOOK YOUR SLOT</h2>
<p><em>When?</em> We deliver from Monday to Friday from 12 am to 3 pm. Since we start with 1 rider and 1 zone and we plan to manage two orders/hour, we have 6 slots per day and 30 slots per week. </p>
<p><em>Where?</em> We deliver from our Partner-Restaurants, that are mostly in  Kreuzberg,&nbsp;to you, who are presumed to be in the Kreuzberg Area as well. If it's Mitte or Friedrichshain or Neuk√∂lln, not so faw away from the Restaurant you want to order it's fine. </p>
